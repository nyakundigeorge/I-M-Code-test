# 2. Execute the command on the Terminal/CommandLine `python Main.py`

#  Question 1: b.) Write a function called memoize that takes any other function as input and returns a memoized version of that function
# 1. Takes the func as an argument and returns a function
# 2. Create a dictionary that'll hold the already evaluated/calculated values
# 3. Define a function func_child that takes value that has been passed on the iteration
# 4. Checks whether the entry with this val exists in teh local_copy, If not call the function to calculate it's value

#  Question 1: c.)Use the function in 3 above to memoize the is Prime function you wrote for problem 2

# Question 2. Write a function search  that accepts two arguments:
# a) A collection of values
# b) a value to find in the collection

# The function search should implement a binary search on the collection.
# If the value isnâ€™t found in the collection, then the search function should return -1.
# If the value is found in the collection, then the function should return the first index of the value in the array.


# Assumptions:
# Our Collection will be ordered

# My first solution will be a recursive one since Binary Search involves splitting the collection into two halves
# and comparing the midvalue with the value to search, such that if the midvalue is less than the value to search
# we'll proceed to search the upper half otherwise we'll search the lower half till we find the position of the value we're looking for
# Conclusion: the recursive solution slices the initial collection hence making it hard for me to get the index of the value_to_find,

# My Second and  solution will be a Iterative one since Binary Search involves splitting the collection into two halves
# and comparing the midvalue with the value to search, such that if the midvalue is less than the value to search
# Our main trick will be shifting the index_of_the first_item or index_of_the_last_item depending on whether the value in the midpoint
# is greater or less than the value_to_find
# Conclusion: the Interative solution was able to allow me find the index of the value_to_find if it existed in the collection since
# this solution doesn't invovle slicing the initial collection

    index_of_first_item = 0
    index_of_last_item = len(collection)-1  # Lists in python are zero based

# our idea is to check that the index_of_the_first_item is always less than or equal to index_of_the_last_item.
# It's needful to mention that we're the found boolean variable is important since it'll help to stop the iteration.
# if the value_to_find is greater than the midpoint then we'll shift our index_of_first_item to the position middle_item + 1
# otherwise we'll shift the index_of_last_item to middle_item - 1
